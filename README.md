# Cursor Cat (Oneko) - Browser Extension

## This is a fork of [oneko.js](https://github.com/adryd325/oneko.js). I did not make this. All credit goes to [@adryd325](https://github.com/adryd325)

This is a browser extension that adds a cute cat to your web browser that chases your cursor. It is a fork of the original [oneko.js](https://github.com/adryd325/oneko.js) project.

While the original `oneko.js` was a script to be included on a single website, this extension allows you to have the cat on any webpage you visit.
